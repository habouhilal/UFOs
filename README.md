# UFOs

## Overview 
In this challenge, we are building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Also, we are creating filters to make this table fully dynamic. This data is displayed on an HTML page that allow users to interact with. 
following the storyboard that Dana put for the page, we've captured everything we want displayed.


## Results 

Using Data-Driven Documents (D3 for short), we added interactive functionality, such as when users enter text that filter the table. It works by "listening" for events, such as a button click or text change, then reacts according to the code we've created.
We provided a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
Using JavaScript and HTML, we were able to modify the code in the index.html file to create more table filters.

### Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

User will enter one or more search criteria 

once the user press Enter or click anywhere on the page the table filter and display only the data that the user is searching for:


## Summary

Overall, this project is very fun to realize for Dana. However, one of the drawbacks can be that the data may be outdated. 

We can suggest: 
- Update the data regularly
- Make a dropdown list on the search field for the user to choose the option that exist on the data table. 
- Add more filters : for example duration by range of time
